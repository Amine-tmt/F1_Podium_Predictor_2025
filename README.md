[![Deployed on Render](https://img.shields.io/badge/deployed-Render-purple.svg)](https://render.com)

A machine learning model that predicts Formula 1 driver finishing positions using historical race data from 2019-2025. Built with XGBoost and deployed as a FastAPI web service.

## üöÄ Features

- Predicts F1 race finishing positions with high accuracy
- RESTful API for real-time predictions
- Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning
- Web interface for easy interaction
- Deployed on Render.com for production use

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes various factors including starting grid position, circuit characteristics, driver performance, and team dynamics to predict where drivers will finish in a race.

## üõ† Tech Stack

### Machine Learning
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor
- **Framework**: scikit-learn for preprocessing and model pipeline
- **Data Processing**: pandas for data manipulation
- **Model Serialization**: joblib for model persistence

### Web Application
- **API Framework**: FastAPI 0.116.1
- **Server**: Uvicorn 0.35.0 (ASGI server)
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 3.1.4
- **Dependency Management**: requirements.txt

## Dataset

### Data Sources
- **Time Period**: 2019-2025 Formula 1 seasons
- **Total Records**: 2,503 race results
- **Features**: Year, Circuit Name, Driver Name, Team, Starting Grid Position
- **Target Variable**: Final Position

### Data Characteristics
- **Circuits**: 35 unique tracks including Monaco, Silverstone, Monza, Spa-Francorchamps
- **Drivers**: 39 different drivers from recent F1 seasons
- **Teams**: All major constructors including Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, McLaren, etc.

### Data Cleaning
- Removed records with "DQ" (disqualified) and "NC" (not classified) and "DNF" (did not finish) results
- Converted Final Position to integer type
- Handled missing values through dropna()
